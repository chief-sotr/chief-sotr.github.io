Hi there! 

Iâ€™m Kevin and passionate about making new things that empower individuals reach their full potential.

Currently looking for my next gig to support teams ship the right product to help users meet their own goals. 

Before that I worked at Kettle to build transformative digital product experiences for brands like Nat Geo, Apple, SoFi, Zocdoc, etc.

I develop my own photos, plant a lot things, read some books.

Not really good with social media but you can find me <a href="http://www.instagram.com/kevinvillert">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kevin.villert">Facebook</a> or simply shoot me an <a href="mailto:chief@sundayontheroof.com">email.
