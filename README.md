# Hi there! 

I’m Kevin and passionate about making new things that empower individuals reach their full potential.

Currently looking for my next gig to support teams ship the right product to help users meet their own goals. 

Before that I worked at Kettle to build transformative digital product experiences for brands like Nat Geo, Apple, SoFi, Zocdoc, etc.

I develop my own photos, plant a lot things, read some books.

Not really good with social media but you can find me <a href="http://www.instagram.com/kevinvillert">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kevin.villert">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinvillert/">Linkedin</a> or simply shoot me an <a href="mailto:chief@sundayontheroof.com">email.

## My frameworks: 

My mission is to discover a product/feature that is valuable, usable and feasible to solve human problems.

- Adept: 5W’s, Value vs. Effort, Story Mapping, Eisenhower Matrix, MoSCoW, Scrum
- Familiar: SWOT, 4D's, ICE/RICE, Scrum Poker, RAD, Kanbam
- Less familiar: HEART Framework, AARRR
- Want to learn: Working Backward, Behavioral Economics

## My principles: 

No PM developed skills equally, as no team organization is created identical. These are the principles I earned and nurtured in my career: 

- CEO of the product: A leader without power/authority that strive to accomplish things with inspiration, vision, and analysis while keeping in mind that it’s a team sport. You’re not going at things alone. 
- Coach : Embrace the holistic problem, rally the team players, inspire and create a desire to fix problems. Optimist. Removes distractions. Guide to victory. 
- Hammer: Be the the force that makes things happen. You don’t let people create vagueness; you make people commit to a clear position and establish course of action. You drive to resolution.
- Router: A lot of what you do is act as “traffic cop” and route things to the right place.
- “Spidey-sense” like instincts for the product, and the ability to channel multiple POVs.
- Empathy: be a great listener to feedback from testers and others who try it to better meet their needs.
- Culturally engineer: you have the DNA of a hacker.
- Super user: use the product obsessively that you will develop and nurture accurate instincts for the ways in which the product can and should improve human lives.
- Janitor: Do as much of the dirty work as possible so everyone else doesn’t have to (QA, testing, legal, financing, meetings, etc.).
- Inventor: must be of creative type, who can generate and churn through many ideas all at once, arrive at solutions to difficult and multi-faceted problems
